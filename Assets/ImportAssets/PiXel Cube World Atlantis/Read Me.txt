Hello.

Thank you for purchasing Pixel Cube World Antlantis package.


There are 27 different fbx files. Seven of them are simple cubes 
wich are good for prototyping or adding detail to bigger blocks.
All models use one atlas texture except the ground objects.
Colliders are generated on import.

Tris count range from 8 to 5662.

These models can be used in mobile games in some extent.
If you build a bigger scene with many objects..keep an eye for the poly count.
Note that using the simple six sided blocks for building big enviroments
will end up in bigger polycounts.

There is a simple texture ofset script included. Its there to add some visual
spice to the water. You can change the speed of scrolling on the inspector.

Have some fun with the enviroment :) Import a character and run around.

Please tell us on our website how you think this package could be made better.
